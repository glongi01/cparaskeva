I would like to thank the organisers for giving us the opportunity to launch the handbook on internal displacement during this event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Displacement<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The displacement of millions of people worldwide presents a key human rights and humanitarian challenge. The precise number of IDPs population is difficult to determine as governments often do not keep any record of internal movements of their populations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IDPs as such, contrary to refugees, who are protected by the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, are not protected by any international legally-binding instrument and their fundamental rights are not safeguarded at international level by any specific instrument. The issue of IDPs is often regarded as an internal matter of the country concerned and attracts much less attention from the international community than the issue of refugees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The 1998 UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1998 UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement remain the main normative instrument which guides and assists governments to discharge their responsibilities in protecting and assisting people forcibly displaced within their countries.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the Guiding Principles are not a binding instrument, they reflect and are consistent with international human rights and humanitarian law, and have been endorsed as an \u201cimportant international framework for the protection of internally displaced persons\u201d by key international fora. (2005 World Summit Outcome, U.N. Doc. A\/60\/L.1, para. 132; Human Rights Council Resolution 6\/32 (2007), para. 5; General Assembly Resolution 62\/153 (2008), para. 10).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cpersons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally-recognized State border\u201d (Guiding Principles on Internally Displaced Persons, para. 2).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This definition was created in recognition of the many common protection needs and problems that persons in these situations tend to share. IDPs are similar to \u2192 refugees in the sense that they may share the same experiences, needs, fears, and wants. Consequently, IDPs are sometimes referred to as \u2018internal refugees\u2019. However, this label is misleading as there is a significant legal distinction between IDPs and refugees which stems primarily from the fact that a refugee has crossed an international frontier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The \u201cPrinciples on Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the ECtHR noted in its recent judgments in&nbsp;<em>Sargsyan v Azerbaijan<\/em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Chiragov v Armenia,&nbsp;<\/em>the \u201cPrinciples on Housing and Property Restitution for Refugees and Displaced Persons\u201d (Commission on Human Rights, Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, 28 June 2005, E\/CN.4\/Sub.2\/2005\/17, Annex) are the most complete standards on the issue. They are also known as the Pinheiro principles. The aim of these principles, which are grounded within existing international human rights and humanitarian law, is to provide international standards and practical guidelines to States, UN agencies and the broader international community on how best to address the complex legal and technical issues surrounding housing and property restitution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>IDPs in CoE member states<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to PACE estimates, in early 2014<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;some 2.5 to 2.8 million Europeans were internally displaced in 11 of the 47 member states of the CoE: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Georgia, Moldova, Russian Federation, \u201cthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\u201d, Serbia and Turkey.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 2009 Recommendation, PACE noted that the vast majority of displaced persons were forced to leave their homes \u201csome 15 to 35 years ago as a result of armed conflicts or human rights violations, and are living in situations of protracted displacement\u201d.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;In addition, these numbers do not include the approximately 1.8 million IDPs registered in Ukraine by the Ministry of Social Policy since the annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine in April 2014.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such figures can only provide an estimate of the numbers of IDPs given the difficulties in recording IDPs and the absence of data collection systems across all relevant CoE member states. Nonetheless, the rise in the numbers of IDPs has been described as \u201cconsiderably alarming<em>\u201d<\/em>&nbsp;by PACE, because, among others,&nbsp;&nbsp;many IDPs are housed in collective centres under, what have been described,&nbsp;<em>\u201c<\/em>deplorable conditions<em>\u201d<\/em>.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn5\"><sup>[5]<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Internal displacement in Europe<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal displacement in Europe, excluding the recent conflict in Ukraine, has continued unabated&nbsp;<em>\u201c<\/em>with only about a quarter of the overall number of IDPs in Europe having found a durable solution to displacement, mostly in the Balkan region<em>\u201d<\/em>.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn6\"><sup>[6]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;It is noted that the key to ensuring full enjoyment of human rights by IDPs in Europe lies in combined and reinvigorated efforts by the local, national and international actors in terms of finding political solutions to protracted conflicts, improved legal and normative frameworks and increased will and capacity of all relevant actors to implement such frameworks.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn7\"><sup>[7]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;However, real solutions are difficult to achieve for IDPs as long as the underlying causes of displacement such as protracted conflicts and ethnic divisions are not addressed. The governments of some CoE member states still do not exercise effective control over their entire territory because of ongoing and\/or unresolved conflicts.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn8\"><sup>[8]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;The ability of IDPs to exercise their rights has been limited and their return has been obstructed due to stalled peace negotiations, or even backtracking from existing peacekeeping and peace-building mechanisms, the absence of organised reconciliation mechanisms and continued insecurity.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn9\"><sup>[9]<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CoE standards and ECHR case law on internal displacement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The CoE has increasingly taken an interest in the issue of IDPs as&nbsp;a large number of citizens in its member states are denied the full protection of their human rights as a consequence of having been forced or obliged to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, without crossing an internationally recognised state border.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PACE has adopted various recommendations and resolutions on issues concerning IDPs. It has consistently called on governments to seek durable solutions for the return, local integration or integration elsewhere in the home countries of the displaced and to guarantee the protection of their rights under the provisions of relevant CoE instruments while remaining in line with the UN Guiding Principles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2006, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted its Recommendation CM\/Rec (2006)6 in which it agreed on a set of 13 recommendations regarding&nbsp;&nbsp;IDPs,&nbsp;&nbsp;building on the Guiding Principles and underlining the binding obligations undertaken by&nbsp;&nbsp;CoE member states.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn10\"><sup>[10]<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than simply integrating the&nbsp;<em>Guiding Principles&nbsp;<\/em>into the European context, this Recommendation,<sup>&nbsp;<\/sup>goes further by emphasising the binding obligations already undertaken by CoE member states that surpass the level of commitment reflected in the Guiding Principles.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the adoption of a Recommendation does not create new legal obligation for states, the process of drafting and adopting the Recommendations, which concludes with their adoption by consensus, indicates that member states are already in agreement about the need to work towards improvement in the area concerned and may even be in a state of preliminary preparedness for responding to suggestions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>European Convention on Human Rights<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IDPs in member states of the CoE enjoy the additional protection of their fundamental rights through the ECHR, which remains undoubtedly the most effective tool of protection for the IDPs in Europe.&nbsp;The ECtHR has described the ECHR as \u201ca constitutional instrument of European public order (<em>ordre public<\/em>)\u201d in the field of human rights.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn11\"><sup>[11]<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since all CoE member states have acceded to the ECHR, each individual IDP who is under the jurisdiction of a CoE member state is entitled to the protection of all the rights and freedoms of the ECHR as provided by Article 1 and has the right to apply to the ECtHR in Strasbourg.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As discussed in the handbook that we launch today, the ECtHR has delivered a series of landmark decisions finding numerous violations of the human rights of IDPs, directly caused by their displacement. Therefore, the handbook seeks to analyse the relevant jurisprudence of the ECtHR in the context of internal displacement. It includes chapters on:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-roman\">\n<li>Right to enjoyment of possessions (Article 1 Protocol No. 1 to the ECHR)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Right to home (Article 8 of the ECHR)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Family life and missing persons (Articles 2, 3, 5 &amp; 13 of the ECHR)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Freedom of movement (Article 2 Protocol No. 4 to the ECHR)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Electoral rights of IDPs (Article 3 Protocol No. 1 to the ECHR)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Protection against Discrimination (Article 14 of the ECHR &amp; Article 1 Protocol No. 12 to the ECHR)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Social Protection of IDPs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IDP\u2019s, are mainly dependent on state assistance or international\/regional humanitarian organisations for the provision of minimum subsistence needs such as housing, healthcare, food and water. IDP\u2019s are also in need of employment and access to education, without which they remain dependent indefinitely on state assistance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ECHR does not include guarantees for socio-economic rights as such. Nonetheless, there have been several cases in which in interpreting ECHR rights, such as those guaranteed by Articles 2, 3, and 8, the ECtHR explored the possibility of extending ECHR protection to certain socio-economic rights as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In&nbsp;<em>Stec and Others v. the United Kingdom<\/em>,<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn12\"><sup>[12]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;the ECtHR set out its approach to the relationship between political and civil rights on one hand and social and economic rights on the other as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst the Convention sets forth what are essentially civil and political rights, many of them have implications of a social or economic nature. The mere fact that an interpretation of the Convention may extend into the sphere of social and economic rights should not be a decisive factor against such an interpretation; there is no watertight division separating that sphere from the field covered by the Convention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the ECtHR\u2019s jurisprudence regarding these matters so far does not concern IDPs, it is reasonable to assume that given the extremes of deprivation suffered by people in the context of displacement, the same reasoning will be applicable if relevant cases reach the ECtHR\u2019s docket.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Handbook, in the chapter for Social protection of IDPs concentrates on the following issues:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:1\">\n<li>Basic shelter and adequate housing<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to healthcare<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to food and water<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to education and vocational training<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to employment and social protection<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Access to justice<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Sargsyan v.

In its most recent cases concerning IDPs, i.e.&nbsp;<em>Sargsyan v.

Therefore, because a number of landmark judgments of the ECtHR related to displacement concern Cyprus, it has been necessary to rely and make systematic reference to the Cyprus cases throughout this handbook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CoE instruments that are binding on member states<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the ECHR, there are other CoE instruments that are binding on member states,<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/A690E15C-3C96-4E75-9DE6-77B8D0D3662B#_ftn17\"><sup>[17]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;and there are a number of CoE mechanisms to monitor countries\u2019 obligations under these instruments. Of particular importance is the protection mechanism provided by the European Social Charter and the revised Social Charter. The European Committee of Social Rights (ESCR) oversees country compliance with the ESC and the ESC(r) through a periodic reporting procedure and a collective complaints procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the latter, international NGOs which are listed as having standing with the ECSR, as well as certain national NGOs, trade unions and employer organisations can submit collective complaints. One such complaint dealing with internal displacement was the 2010 decision,&nbsp;<em>Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions v.
