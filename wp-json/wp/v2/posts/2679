What does the economic crisis entail for human rights? Is protection of human rights taken into account in these times of crisis? How difficult and how successful is the attempt to protect human rights in times of crisis?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law is&nbsp;a core value held in common, by all EU and Council of Europe member states.&nbsp;Strong democratic institutions and the rule of law play an important role in preventing threats to security. \u0391 failure by states to secure adequate and functioning democratic institutions that can promote stability, may in themselves give rise to a number of threats in the same way as systematic violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Terrorism,<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>one of the central threats in the current security environment, will remain a key challenge to peace and stability, particularly through its use of asymmetric methods to bypass traditional security and defence systems.&nbsp;Terrorist attacks are rightly perceived as a direct attack on the fundamental values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Very often states in their efforts to combat terrorism tend to disregard commonly accepted standards of international law and human rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Terrorism and measures to combat terrorism, pose major challenges to the international protection of human rights, both regarding their content and their application. Governments have often been tempted to depart from ordinary laws, normal procedures, or the fundamental rights of the individual, when confronted with acts of and threat of terrorism. Since 9\/11, an unprecedented wave of special legislation or special powers has emerged all over the world, and many human rights have come under attack or \u201creconsideration\u201d. While most human rights are not absolute but allow for some limitations to protect public security, in many cases governments have gone beyond these permissible limitations, resulting in human rights violations.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A relatively small number of individuals are subjected to grave human rights violations, such as torture, or extra-judicial execution. At the same time all members of society face new interferences with some of their human rights because of counter-terrorism legislation. Typically, everyone\u2019s right to privacy is affected by new rules on interception of communication, databases and data restriction, and exchange of personal information across borders.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/84F68C39-83F5-43B5-913F-9CB6D11AE464#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;Furthermore, certain groups of individuals are affected more than the average citizen by counter-terrorism measures and many of these interferences easily escalate into violations of human rights law.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/84F68C39-83F5-43B5-913F-9CB6D11AE464#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;Immigrants or ethnic or religious minorities are often targeted by counter-terrorism measures affecting a broad range of human rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping all counter-terrorism legislation under careful public scrutiny is probably the best way to ensure that measures justified as targeting the \u201creal terrorists\u201d do not result in the erosion of human rights in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respect for and compliance with international law and the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights should remain central to efforts to prevent and combat threats to stability and security and particularly in their actions against terrorism.&nbsp;The European Court of Human Rights is the first international Jurisdiction to deal with the phenomenon of terrorism. For many decades and through hundreds of cases, it has elaborated a clear, integrated and articulated body of case law on responses to terrorism from a human rights perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In no circumstances must respect for human rights be regarded as an obstacle to effectively combating terrorism.&nbsp;States should take the necessary measures, including preventive measures, to protect individuals\u2019 fundamental rights when those rights, especially the right to life, are threatened by criminal actions. It may be said that when human rights protection underlies anti-terrorist measures, the latter are legitimised as means for ensuring that the rule of law remains paramount in a democracy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>States should reconcile the imperatives of public security with the safeguarding of individual fundamental rights and not resort to measures, which undermine the very values they seek to protect \u2013 and the very values the terrorists seek to destroy. To quote the words of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of&nbsp;<em>Klass and Others v. Germany<\/em>&nbsp;in 1978, expressed in the context of the Red Army Faction under Baader-Meinhof in Germany and reaffirmed since then each time the Court has dealt with cases involving anti-terrorist measures, we must not fall into the trap of \u201cundermining or even destroying democracy on the grounds of defending it\u201d.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/84F68C39-83F5-43B5-913F-9CB6D11AE464#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is widely accepted that the current economic crisis is another factor, which poses a serious challenge to the protection of human rights, not only in the EU but around the world. The challenges include: rising unemployment, shrinking public spending, and possibly also rising xenophobia or racism. It is also widely recognised that the rights of already disadvantaged groups are particularly at risk from the crisis, including children, women, persons with disabilities, young adults, migrants, ethnic minorities and refugees. In addition, the resources and capacity of redress mechanisms and human rights organisations are also affected.&nbsp;As economy risks shrinking there is a growing risk that essential programmes for education, health care, or social assistance will suffer from budget cuts &#8211; at a time when they are most needed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Measures designed to promote fiscal stability could undermine protection for human rights contrary to the Charter for Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention on Human Rights.&nbsp;States are under enormous pressure to embark on austerity programmes, sometimes severe, in the face of rising public deficit and poor economic growth. Decisions to adopt austerity measures are always difficult and complex, and this may lead many states to take decisions with sometimes painful effects, especially when these austerity measures are taken in a recession.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obligations of states lie primarily in the choices they make in response to the economic crisis&nbsp;and the merits of these choices with regard to their impact on the protection of human rights.&nbsp; At the moment, we face a potential human rights crisis, which arises from an inappropriate response to the economic crisis.&nbsp;In order to address that potential human rights crisis states need to frame and evaluate their responses to the economic crisis in line with their obligations under human rights law and principles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any proposed policy change or adjustment has to meet the following requirements: first the policy is a temporary measure covering only the period of crisis; second, the policy is necessary and proportionate, in the sense that the adoption of any other policy, or a failure to act, would be more detrimental to human rights; third, the policy is not discriminatory and comprises all possible measures to support social transfers to mitigate inequalities that can grow in times of crisis and to ensure that the rights of disadvantaged and marginalized individuals and groups are not disproportionately affected; fourth, the policy identifies the minimum core content of rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Governments have a duty to ensure the well-being of their populations, which includes guaranteeing their human rights.&nbsp;States should also respect their obligations in relation to human rights when making decisions, including on official development assistance, in international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, regional financial institutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The European Court of Human Rights in the case of&nbsp;<em>Capital Bank AD v. Bulgaria<\/em><a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/84F68C39-83F5-43B5-913F-9CB6D11AE464#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;held that the state\u2019s position that the prohibition of judicial review of the national authorities\u2019 decision to revoke a bank\u2019s licence was permissible because it was introduced at the demand of the IMF could not necessarily justify the limitation. In the words of the Court \u201cThe Contracting States\u2019 responsibility continues even after they assume international obligations subsequent to the entry into force of the Convention or its Protocols. It would be incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention if the Contracting States, by assuming such obligations, were automatically absolved from their responsibility under the Convention.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/84F68C39-83F5-43B5-913F-9CB6D11AE464#_ftn5\"><sup>[5]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;The Court, while attentive of the need to interpret the Convention in such a manner as to allow the States Parties to comply with their international obligations, must nevertheless in each case be satisfied that the measures in issue are compatible with the Convention or its Protocols\u201d.<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/84F68C39-83F5-43B5-913F-9CB6D11AE464#_ftn6\"><sup>[6]<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main achievements in the area of human rights has been the establishment of national, regional and international mechanisms for their protection. Today strong civil society organisations are in place, and there are powerful national and regional human rights institutions, such as the Council of Europe and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenges posed by security threats and the economies of Europe can serve as an opportunity to develop policies and adopt measures that whilst containing these, promote human rights by establishing red lines beyond which the state cannot intrude.&nbsp;The imperative is that any proposed responses need to be reviewed from the perspective of their effect on the enjoyment of human rights and therefore must be judged in large part on their human rights credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your attention.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/84F68C39-83F5-43B5-913F-9CB6D11AE464#_ftnref1\"><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;See Report of the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism, A\/HRC\/13\/37 (28 September 2009).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/84F68C39-83F5-43B5-913F-9CB6D11AE464#_ftnref2\"><sup>[2]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;For an assessment of gender impact of counter-terrorism, see Report of the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-terrorism, A\/64\/211 (3 August 2009).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/84F68C39-83F5-43B5-913F-9CB6D11AE464#_ftnref3\"><sup>[3]<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;<em>Klass and Others v.
