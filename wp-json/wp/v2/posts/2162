These are applications (mainly coming from the new member states of Council of Europe) deriving from a structural or systemic situation in the respondent member state, which generates large numbers of, by definition, well-founded cases. The purpose of designating a case for the \u2018pilot-judgment procedure\u2019 is to process cases that violate the European Convention on Human Rights promptly and effectively. This article identifies the main characteristics and elements of this procedure and the principles applied by the Court when delivering pilot judgments. Furthermore, it discusses the application of this approach to various situations revealing systemic problems. Finally, the article critically evaluates the effectiveness, the weaknesses and the prospects of this procedure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Abstract This article analyses the \u2018pilot judgment procedure\u2019 developed by the European Court of Human Rights (after the adoption of the \u2018reform package\u2019 of measures in May 2004, including Protocol No.14 to the European Convention on Human Rights) in an attempt to tackle the phenomenon of \u2018repetitive\u2019 or \u2018clone\u2019 cases.
