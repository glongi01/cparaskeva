It does so by means of<strong>&nbsp;periodic visits&nbsp;<\/strong>to all states parties to the Convention establishing the Committee or so-called&nbsp;<strong><em>ad hoc<\/em>&nbsp;visits<\/strong>, when such visits are required by the circumstances. For instance, in 2016, the CPT carried out&nbsp;<em>ad hoc<\/em>&nbsp;visits to hotspots in Greece, to Belgium during prison strikes and to Turkey following a failed coup attempt.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Parties are under a legal obligation to&nbsp;<strong>co-operate with the CPT<\/strong>&nbsp;and to provide it with all the necessary facilities to enable it to carry out its task, in particular&nbsp;<strong>access to their territory<\/strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>right to travel without restriction<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>unlimited access to any place where people may be deprived of their liberty<\/strong>&nbsp;and the prerogative of&nbsp;<strong>interviewing detained people in private<\/strong>. The principle of co-operation also includes Government action to implement the Committee\u2019s key recommendations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The CPT\u2019s work is based on&nbsp;<strong>confidentiality<\/strong>. Visit reports and responses are made public at the request of the party concerned only. If the party concerned fails to co-operate or refuses to improve the situation in the light of the Committee\u2019s recommendations, the CPT may exceptionally make a public statement in accordance with Article 10, paragraph 2, of the Convention.&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There is a&nbsp;<strong>continued applicability of the Convention in situations of conflict or periods of occupation<\/strong>. However, the drafters of the CPT Convention also took into account the existence of other international instruments, in particular the&nbsp;<strong>Geneva Conventions<\/strong>&nbsp;of 12 August 1949 and the 8 June 1977 Protocols. In situations of (international or non-international) conflict, the Geneva Conventions must have priority of application. The CPT can proceed to visit certain places where the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) does not visit them \u201ceffectively\u201d or \u201con a regular basis\u201d. This principle of complementarity with the ICRC is enshrined in Article 17, paragraph 3, of the CPT Convention.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nevertheless, there are two main types of&nbsp;<strong>challenges<\/strong>&nbsp;the CPT may be confronted with when it comes to situations of conflict or periods of occupation: insecurity, which has some organisational implications, and the lack of effective control by the party concerned, which may primarily lead to legal and practical obstacles for the CPT to operate effectively in such conditions. [Concrete examples to follow]<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Situations of active or imminent conflict on the territory of a party to the Convention<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The CPT intervened in situations of conflict of varied intensity in the&nbsp;<strong>Northern Caucasian region of the Russian Federation<\/strong>. Although the ICRC had an effective presence for a number of years, places of deprivation of liberty in the region could not be visited effectively or on a regular basis. From 2000 to 2003, the CPT focused all its attention on the Chechen Republic. Since 2004, the Committee has also visited other republics in the region where the level of violence had increased significantly (Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria and North Ossetia). The Committee has so far carried out 13 visits (all of an&nbsp;<em>ad hoc<\/em>&nbsp;nature) to the Northern Caucasian region, including 11 visits to Chechnya. Before carrying out these visits, the CPT requested specific arrangements to ensure the safety of its delegations and enable them to carry out their task. In practical terms, such visits required the allocation of special teams for the protection of CPT delegations during their movements within the region. Only one visit report on the region has been so far made public. The Committee lifted on its own initiative the veil of confidentiality in the form of a public statement in 2001, 2003 and 2007 as regards the Chechen Republic.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>On rare occasions, a visit may be postponed due to the breakout of a conflict or a high level of violence. In these instances, the party concerned made representations as to the relevant circumstances to the Committee in compliance with Article 9 of the Convention (e.g. safeguarding national security). This happened, for instance, in 2008, after the CPT notified the Georgian authorities of its intention to visit its breakaway regions of&nbsp;<strong>Abkhazia&nbsp;<\/strong>and<strong>&nbsp;South Ossetia<\/strong>. The notification process coincided with a heightening of tension in relation to these regions, which led shortly after to an armed conflict between Georgia and the Russian Federation. The CPT and Georgia then sought agreement to enable the Committee to exercise its function. As a result, Abkhazia was visited by the CPT the following year, in 2009.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>The specific situation of Kosovo<sup>*<\/sup><\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Kosovo<a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/D738FD01-9A5A-4E3B-809F-214B03A27015#_ftn1\"><sup>*<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;conflict led to the adoption of a resolution by the United Nations Security Council \u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/documents-dds-ny.un.org\/doc\/UNDOC\/GEN\/N99\/172\/89\/PDF\/N9917289.pdf?OpenElement\">Resolution 1244 (1999)<\/a>&nbsp;\u2013 on 10 June 1999. This opened the way towards a special agreement between the&nbsp;Council of Europe&nbsp;and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which was concluded in 2004, and to an exchange of letters with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in 2006. The CPT carried out&nbsp;<em>ad hoc<\/em>&nbsp;visits to Kosovo<sup>*<\/sup>&nbsp;in 2007, 2010 and 2015. All visit reports have been made public.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Frozen conflict areas and self-declared independent territories<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Frozen conflict areas have often led to the emergence of self-proclaimed independent republics which have no or little international recognition. These areas have posed legal and practical challenges for the CPT as the parties concerned have no effective control of these territories. In order to be able to visit these regions, the party concerned should facilitate the work of the CPT by allowing a proper dialogue between the Committee and the&nbsp;<em>de facto<\/em>&nbsp;authorities to develop before, during and after the visit. As far as the&nbsp;<em>de facto<\/em>&nbsp;authorities are concerned, they should accept all the Committee\u2019s prerogatives, even if they usually do not consider themselves formally bound by the provisions of the Convention. In order for these legal and practical obstacles to be overcome, the CPT often had to rely on some support from other international partners, in particular United Nations, OSCE or ICRC field missions.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>There have been successful attempts from the CPT to cover some of these regions, the most obvious one being&nbsp;<strong>Transnistria<\/strong>&nbsp;(Republic of Moldova). The Committee has visited the region four times since 2000. However, the latest visit in 2010 had to be interrupted mainly due to a change of attitude of the&nbsp;<em>de facto<\/em>authorities. Tiraspol no longer agreed that CPT delegations carry out interviews with remand prisoners&nbsp;<em>in private<\/em>. Despite several contacts with Tiraspol since then, the Committee has not yet received sufficient guarantees that it can exercise its function effectively in Transnistria again. It is interesting to note that the Moldovan authorities have refrained from requesting the publication of CPT reports without any positive signals received by the Committee from Tiraspol. This has greatly facilitated continued dialogue for a number of years. The CPT remains committed to returning to Transnistria in a not too distant future.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yet another example is&nbsp;<strong>Abkhazia<\/strong>, which was indeed visited by the CPT in 2009. Regrettably, Georgia, the party concerned to the Convention, requested the publication of the visit report shortly after having received it, without any indication from Sukhumi that it did not object to such publication before a response is provided. The CPT considered that the premature publication of this report had not helped the Committee in its dialogue with the&nbsp;<em>de facto<\/em>&nbsp;authorities. The Committee has since not been able to return to Abkhazia and a second visit to this part of Europe is unlikely to occur in the near future.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There have been serious attempts from the Committee to visit other similar areas (e.g.&nbsp;<strong>Northern Cyprus<\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong>South Ossetia<\/strong>). However, they have so far proved to be unsuccessful.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Annexed territories: the Crimean peninsula (Ukraine)<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The situation of Crimea and Sevastopol is one of the most challenging for the CPT as it formally involves two parties to the Convention establishing it. In legal terms, Ukraine is the only party concerned. However, another party, the Russian Federation, has not only effective control of the Crimean peninsula but it also annexed it to its own territory in 2014. This annexation is not recognised by the Council of Europe, as reiterated in recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/search.coe.int\/cm\/Pages\/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=090000168070ec02\">decisions<\/a>&nbsp;of the Council of Europe\u2019s Ministers\u2019 Deputies at their 1285<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;meeting of 3 May 2017.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The CPT last visited Crimea in October 2013 during a periodic visit to Ukraine. It made a number of recommendations in its visit report adopted in March 2014. It has been unable to monitor their implementation since then.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The CPT Convention leaves little leeway for the Committee about modalities for a return to Crimea: Ukraine should allow, for practical reasons, for a proper dialogue between the CPT and the Russian authorities in the context of a visit whilst the Russian Federation should accept that, legally speaking, Ukraine will be considered as the party concerned in respect of Crimea.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Since 2014, there have been regular calls for allowing monitoring bodies, including the CPT, to visit Crimea. Earlier this month, the Council of Europe\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/search.coe.int\/cm\/Pages\/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=090000168070ec02\">Ministers\u2019 Deputies<\/a>&nbsp;reiterated their call for full and unrestricted access to the Crimean peninsula for all human rights bodies of the Council of Europe in order that they can carry out their monitoring activities unimpeded and in accordance with their mandates to urgently address deteriorations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. This came after a similar call from the Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the April 2017 session of the Parliamentary Assembly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>There are still grounds for hope of a possible return of the CPT to Crimea. The recent joint visit of the ombudspersons of Ukraine and the Russian Federation to Crimea in December 2016&nbsp;is a positive sign.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><u>Concluding remarks<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The CPT has always believed that there should be&nbsp;<strong>no human rights vacuum<\/strong>&nbsp;anywhere in the European continent and that it is in the interests of everyone that the Committee exercise \u2013 and be seen to exercise \u2013 its preventive mandate in every part of Europe.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The CPT remains committed to leaving no grey areas in the prevention of ill-treatment in the parties to the Convention establishing it.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"applewebdata:\/\/D738FD01-9A5A-4E3B-809F-214B03A27015#_ftnref1\"><sup>*<\/sup><\/a>&nbsp;All reference to Kosovo, whether to the territory, institutions or population, in this text shall be understood in full compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 and without prejudice to the status of Kosovo.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Conference&nbsp;under the auspices of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe (26-27 May 2017, Nafplion, Greece) Human Dignity in times of Conflicts and Crises Human Rights and Humanitarian Law at crossroads 2ndRound Table Methodology of monitoring and fact-finding in armed conflicts and crises situations presentation by Costas Paraskeva Member of the Council of Europe\u2019s &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/cparaskeva.com\/2017\/05\/26\/international-conference-human-dignity-in-periods-of-conflicts-and-crises-human-rights-and-humanitarian-law-at-crossroads-under-the-auspices-of-mr-thorbjorn-jagland-secretary-ge\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">International Conference, \u201cHuman Dignity in periods of conflicts and crises.
