The Report is divided into two main parts, regarding respectively the presumption of innocence (broadly defined) and the right to be present. Apart from the state of the law, the Report also considers practices in the Member States in an attempt to contribute best practices to the discussion and help the judges and practitioners who will be called to apply the new regime in handling real, often difficult, cases.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Abstract This General Report evaluates the actual implementation of Directive (EU) 2016\/343 on the strengthening of certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedings across the EU Member States.
